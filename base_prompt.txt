we're on ubuntu 
I'm trying to make an application that will teach the user new tmux controls
basically like, AI / llm / claude powered
takes their tmux config as input
then claude looks online for new configurations / controls they can try
it then takes them into a containerized environment where they can try these controls in conjunction with their current config
if they don't like the new controls, they can just throw them out (and since it's containeried, this can be the default)
and if they do like the new controls, claude can integrate them into the current environment
I'd prefer the way the controls are learned to be like a mini challenge / showing the suggested keybinds directly (which can also be based on the user's existing config, e.g. if I have alt + hjkl for window navigation, could do something near those for a similar navigation command, etc)
