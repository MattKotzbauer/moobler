Here is the user's current tmux configuration:

```
{{userConfig}}
```

Here are popular keybindings from GitHub configs (use as inspiration, ADAPT to user's style):

{{githubKeybinds}}
{{categoryFocus}}

IMPORTANT: First analyze the user's config to identify their patterns:
- Do they use `bind -n` (no prefix) or `bind` (with prefix)?
- What modifiers do they prefer (M- for Alt, C- for Ctrl)?
- What keys are already taken?

Then suggest keybindings that use the SAME style. If they use Alt+key bindings everywhere,
suggest more Alt+key bindings - NOT prefix bindings.

Return valid JSON with user_style_analysis and groups.
