<task>
1. Analyze the user's config to identify their patterns:
   - Do they use `bind -n` (no prefix) or `bind` (with prefix)?
   - What modifiers do they prefer (M- for Alt, C- for Ctrl)?
   - What keys are already taken?

2. Suggest keybindings using the SAME style as the user.
   If they use Alt+key bindings everywhere, suggest Alt+key bindings - NOT prefix bindings.

3. Return valid JSON with user_style_analysis and groups.
